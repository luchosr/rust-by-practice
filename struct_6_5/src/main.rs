//exercise_1:ðŸŒŸ We must specify concrete values for each of the fields in struct.

// exercise_2:ðŸŒŸ Unit struct don't have any fields. It can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

// *************WIP*************

struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behaviors defined here.
}

// We don't care about what fields  are  in the Unit, but we care about its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it

//exercise_3:ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Tuple struct looks similar to tuples, it has added meaning the struct name provides but has no named fields. It's useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name, but don't care about the fields's names.

// Fix the error and fill the blanks
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

 //exercise_4:ðŸŒŸ You can make a whole struct mutable when instantiating it, but Rust doesn't allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.

// Fill the blank and fix the error without adding/removing new line

    p.age = 30;

    // Fill the blank
